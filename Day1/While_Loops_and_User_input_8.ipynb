        "    2 + 99 = 101\n",
        "    3 + 98 = 101\n",
        "\n",
        "Gauss realized there were exactly 50 pairs of numbers in the range 1 to 100, so he did a quick calculation: 50 * 101 = 5050.\n",

        "- Write a program that passes a list of numbers to a function.\n",
        "    - The function should use a while loop to keep popping the first and last numbers from the list and calculate the sum of those two numbers.\n",
        "    - The function should print out the current numbers that are being added, and print their partial sum.\n",
        "    - The function should keep track of how many partial sums there are.\n",
        "    - The function should then print out how many partial sums there were.\n",
        "    - The function should perform Gauss' multiplication, and report the final answer.\n",
        "- Prove that your function works, by passing in the range 1-100, and verifying that you get 5050.\n",
        "    - `gauss_addition(list(range(1,101)))`\n",
        "- Your function should work for any set of consecutive numbers, as long as that set has an even length.\n",
